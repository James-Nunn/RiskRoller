#  Risk Roller App

## Made for the Risk board game

Battling with large armies can take a lot of repetitive dice rolls as you can only lose 2 men at a time.

With this app users can: 
- Enter their attacking and defending troop count
- Compute Dice rolls and deaths at the push of a button
- Roll digital dice with drag or shake feature for fun
- View all dice rolls and computation log (coming soon) 
- Dice roll and death log

Big thanks to https://gist.github.com/ralfebert for the onShake extension
